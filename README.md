# lims-update-product-id
Update ProductID udf attached to submitted samples in the VSeq and Exome+ workflows. 

## Usage
The script takes the LIMS username and password, Root URI for the API, File Name, and the new ProductID parameters as command-line arguments.
```sh
python3 update_product_id.py -u {username} -p {password} -r {root_uri} -f {file_name or file_path} -pi {product_id}
```
Example:
```sh
python3 update_product_id.py -u {username} -p {password} -r https://test.lims.lusk.helix.net/api/v2 -f test_lusk_samples_01.csv -pi 99999_22222_22222_11111
```
### CSV File
The script takes the list of samples from a csv file. The csv should not contain a header. Each row should contain a single sample and all samples should be within the first column. 

> Note: As suggested by Semaphore, the list will be split into groups of `96 samples` because the `query()` and `batch_update()` operations can fail with too large a number of samples.
## Errors
You may come across:
```sh
ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

By default SSL validation is disabled, but for some reason it still attempts to validate. 
```sh
class s4.clarity.LIMS(root_uri, username, password, dry_run=False, insecure=False, log_requests=False, timeout=None)
```
> insecure (bool) â€“ Disables SSL validation. Default false.

To get get around this, you may need to temporarily modify the Python Requests library. I needed to modify this file: `/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests/sessions.py`
sessions.py: 
```sh
#: SSL Verification default.
#: Defaults to `True`, requiring requests to verify the TLS certificate at the
#: remote end.
#: If verify is set to `False`, requests will accept any TLS certificate
#: presented by the server, and will ignore hostname mismatches and/or
#: expired certificates, which will make your application vulnerable to
#: man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
#: Only set this to `False` for testing.
self.verify = True
```
Setting `self.verify = False` and re-run the script.
